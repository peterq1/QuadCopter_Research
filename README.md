QuadCopter_Research
===================


This is our research team's Flight Control code with a PID controller. One Gumstix Overo 
FireSTORM was used as the main Flight Control board and another was used, with an e-CAM56
attachment, to capture imagae data. The sensors used were the VN-100 Rugged IMU/AHRS, 
an Ultrasonic Range Finder and a Pololu Micro Maestro servo controller.

-Code is continuously being updated
