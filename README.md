QuadCopter_Research
===================


Our research team's Flight Control code with a PID controller. One Gumstix Overo 
FireSTORM was used as the main Flight Control board and another was used, with an e-CAM56
attachment, to capture image data. The sensors used were the VN-100 Rugged IMU/AHRS and 
an Ultrasonic Range Finder. A Pololu Micro Maestro servo controller was used to control 
the four DC motors.

-Code enables the user to adjust PID gain coefficients and the base speed in real time 
-Code is continuously being updated
